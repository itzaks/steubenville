    August 11–12, 2012, a young girl in Steubenville, Ohio was raped under horrific circumstances.

    On March 17, 2013, two young men were convicted of the crime. 

    As <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/cnn-steubenville-rape-poppy-harlow-144458279.html" target="_blank">this blog post</a> details, CNN took charge in <a href="http://gawker.com/5991003/cnn-reports-on-the-promising-future-of-the-steubenville-rapists-who-are-very-good-students" target="_blank">“publicly worry[ing] about the 'promising future'</a> of the convicted rapists” – not giving the victim much thought at all.

    This was not – is not – limited to mainstream media. This sort of behaviour thrives on Twitter. And often stands unchallenged. Until now. 

    We've gathered and will continue to gather atrocious tweets that deserve to be replied to; to be challenged – to show that we are many that will not tolerate this kind of behaviour, nor the culture that supports it.
